📊 Statistical Foundation of Data Sciences

This repository contains all my practicals, exercises, and implementations related to the Statistical Foundations of Data Science. I will be continuously updating this repo with new notebooks, scripts, and examples as I progress in my learning.

🚀 Overview

Statistics is a key backbone of Data Science. In this repository, I explore and implement:

Descriptive statistics

Probability distributions

Hypothesis testing

Correlation & regression

Data visualization and interpretation

And more advanced concepts as I move forward

🛠️ Technologies Used

The practicals are implemented primarily using Python and the following libraries:

NumPy
 – Numerical computations

Pandas
 – Data manipulation & analysis

Matplotlib
 – Data visualization

Seaborn
 – Statistical data visualization
 📅 Updates

This repository will be updated regularly as I complete new practicals and experiments.
